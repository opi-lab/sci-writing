##  Course description

The "Scientific Article Writing" course is designed to equip students with the skills necessary to write and publish scientific papers effectively. The course covers the structure of scientific papers, including sections such as the title, abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion. Students will learn the importance of ethical considerations, proper citation, and the peer review process. 

A special focus will be given to modern writing tools, including generative AI, and their role in scientific writing. The course also provides guidance on selecting the right journal and navigating the submission process. A unique feature of this course is the inclusion of guest lecturers from around the world, offering students a global perspective on scientific writing. Towards the end of the course, students will have the opportunity to write a review paper and participate in a peer review workshop. The course concludes with the submission of a final paper. This course is aimed at graduate students looking to enhance their scientific writing skills and understanding of the publication process.

### Learning outcomes
At the end of the course, one would be able to:
- RA3: Develop scientific material that contributes knowledge to their area of research.
- RA4: Demonstrate the ability to communicate effectively within their academic community at the regional, national, and international level.

## Useful Resources
 
We will be using the LaTeX typesetting language along with other tools like BibTEX or Zotero for reference managament and citations. It is best if you get accquainted with these tools before hand.
